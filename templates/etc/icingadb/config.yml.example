# Connection configuration for the Redis where Icinga writes its configuration, state and history.
# This is the same connection as configured in the 'icingadb' feature of the corresponding Icinga node.
# High availability setups require a dedicated Redis server per Icinga node and
# therefore a dedicated Icinga DB instance that connects to it.
redis:
  # Redis host or absolute Unix socket path.
  host: localhost

  # Redis port. The Redis server provided by the icingadb-redis package listens on port '6380'.
  # If not specified, the standard Redis port '6379' is used instead.
  port: 6380

logging:
  # Default logging level. Can be set to 'fatal', 'error', 'warn', 'info' or 'debug'.
  # If not set, defaults to 'info'.

  # Logging output. Can be set to 'console' (stderr) or 'systemd-journald'.
  # If not set, logs to systemd-journald when running under systemd, otherwise stderr.
#  output:

  # Interval for periodic logging defined as duration string.
  # A duration string is a sequence of decimal numbers and a unit suffix, such as "20s".
  # Valid units are "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  # Defaults to "20s".
#  interval: 20s

  # Map of component-logging level pairs to define a different log level than the default value for each component.
